        <h1>Performance testing notes</h1>
        <h2>Load testing</h2>
        <p>Testing system's performance under normal and expected load</p>
        <h2>Spike testing</h2>
        <p>testing system's performance under sudden and extreme load increases</p>
        <h2>Stress testing</h2>
        <p>type of performance testing where the system is pushed to its limit to determine its breaking point</p>
        <h2>Important performance metrics</h2>
        <h3>http_req_duration</h3>
        <p>This is the time taken to complete the http requests</p>
        <p>avg=143.92ms min=17.09ms med=240.75ms max=616.48ms p(90)=262.72ms p(95)=273.46ms</p>
        <p>Here is an interpretation of the result above:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>avg:</strong> average time for the requests was 143.92ms</li>
            <li><strong>min:</strong> fastest request took 17.09ms</li>
            <li><strong>med:</strong> half of the requests took less than 240.75ms</li>
            <li><strong>max:</strong> slowest request took 616.48ms</li>
            <li><strong>p(90):</strong> 90% of requests took 262.72ms or less</li>
            <li><strong>p(95):</strong> 95% of requests took 273.46ms or less</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Why p(95) is more useful than avg</h4>
        <p>avg can get skewed by outliers. One slow request can ruin the entire result</p>
        <p>p(95) is more reliable because it shows us how consistent the performance is.</p>
        <p>p(95) shows us what most users experience</p>
        <h3>http_req_failed</h3>
        <p>This is the percentage of failed requests</p>
        <p>http_req_failed................: 0.00%  0 out of 402</p>
        <p>This shows that 0% of requests failed</p>
        <h3>http_req_waiting</h3>
        <p>Time spent waiting for the server to respond</p>
        <P>avg=295ms min=12.16ms med=239.26ms max=2.8s    p(90)=996.28ms p(95)=1.27s</P>
        <p>Here is an interpretation of the result above:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>avg:</strong> average server response was 295ms</li>
            <li><strong>min:</strong> fastest server response time was 12.16ms</li>
            <li><strong>med:</strong> half of the requests had a TTFB(Time to First Byte) less than 239.26ms</li>
            <li><strong>max:</strong> slowest server response 2.8s</li>
            <li><strong>p(90):</strong> 90% of requests had a TTFB OF 996.28ms or less</li>
            <li><strong>p(95):</strong> 95% of requests had a TTFB OF 1.27s or less</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>TTFB- time between sending a request to a server and receiving the first byte of the response</strong></p>
